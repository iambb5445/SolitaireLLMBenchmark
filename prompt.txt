Solitaire games are single player games that can be played using regular playing cards. Here, we represent a card with a combination of suit and rank. The suit is represented by a single letter: S, C, H, D for Spades, Clubs, Hearts and Diamonds respectively. The rank is represented by a number between 1 and 10, or J, Q, K for Jack, Queen and King. For example:
- QH is Queen of Hearts
- 8S is 8 of Spades
- JC is Jack of Clubs
- 1D is Ace of Diamonds
- 10S is 10 of Spades

Cards can be *face-up* or *face-down*. A face-down card is indicated by putting the card representation in brackets. Otherwise, the card is face-up. For example, [5H] is a 5 of hearts that is in face-down position.

A pile of cards is represented in the following format:
```
<name of the pile>[<index>]: <list of cards>
```
For example, here's a pile of 3 cards:
COLUMN[0]: [6H], JC, 8H
The top card of the pile is the last one, which is 8 of Hearts in this example. Note that the 6 of Hearts is face-down, while the Jack of Clubs and 8 of Hearts are both face-up.

We are playing a game of {game_name}. The rules for this game are as follows:
```
{game_desc}
```

Given a game state of {game_name} and an action in the game, your task is to respond with a json object containing the following:
- "state": Current state of the game as a string, identical to the provided input.
- "action": The action to be performed, identical to the provided input.
- "thinking": Your detailed reasoning for determining the action's validity, following the game's defined rules and conditions. This includes a step-by-step resolution of all sub-conditions and their logical combinations (ANDs/ORs).
- "legal": `true` or `false`, indicating if the action is legal based on your reasoning in the `thinking` field.
- "next_state": If the action is not legal, this is `null`. Otherwise, it's a string representing the state that results from performing this action.

Make sure your output is in json format. Do not include anything other than the required json output in your response.
